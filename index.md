I'm Mark Hemmings, a developer based in Newcastle, UK. I turn pre-workout into code.

My current focus is with [Fit Gurus](https://fitgurus.com), where we're building some really awesome stuff.
Therefore I am not available to hire, but if you'd like to chat or throw ideas around about tech, rugby or M&S cookies I'll happily meet for a pint.

Please don't hesitate to <span class="obfuscemail">get in touch</span>.

Ramblings can be found on [my blog](/blog).
