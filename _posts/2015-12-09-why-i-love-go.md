title: Why I Love Go
description: I love Go. I've been meaning to blog about why Go is great for a while now, but I could never really find the words. But now Rob Pike has come to the rescue.

_Tl;dr I didn't really know. Then Rob Pike helped me out._

"Go is awesome", I say. "But why?", is the reply once again, and once again I
struggle to explain myself. I can recall many times I've seen talented people
at [Campus North](http://campusnorth.co.uk/)  and [Golang NE](http://www.meetup.com/Golang-North-East/)
communities have the same problem. It's a common yet strange occurrence.

I was scrambling together some reasons to try and finally make clear why I think
Go is so great, going into detail about the tooling, concurrency, speed and all
the other justifications we use to convince the Node, Ruby and PHP interrogators
that we're not just using Go because it's "cool". But ultimately, there was something
I couldn't quite put my finger on.

However, in November I was lucky enough to see Rob Pike, one of the smartest computer
scientists of a generation, speaking at [DotGo](http://www.dotgo.eu/) in Paris, and
he dismantled my draft blog post in 23 minutes. The penny dropped and suddenly my
eyes were opened over the _actual_ reason I love writing in Go. I was never smart
enough to realise it, but now it makes so much sense.

__Simplicity__.

Thank you Rob, for saving me from writing what would've been a very average post.
