title: I Made a Blog
description: Finally, after years of continually restarting, I've made and deployed my website and blog.

Hello world.

It's taken me years but finally I have sat down this weekend and built a place to put some of my thoughts.
This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) by the superb [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo).
It's deployed and hosted with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) meaning you can help me out with spelling corrections and fixes by submitting a PR [here](https://github.com/mhemmings/mhemmings.github.io).

I'll blog more in the future about what I've learned using Jekyll and things to look out for.
